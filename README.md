# JavaScript and HTML Coding Samples

This repository contains a series of coding samplesfocusing on JavaScript and HTML.

## Samples

### Sample 1: External JavaScript Function
Illustrate the implementation of a JavaScript function named `greeting()` using an external `.js` file. The function should display a welcome message when a button on an HTML page is clicked.

### Sample 2: HTML Document with Embedded JavaScript
Write the code for an HTML document with embedded JavaScript scripts. The document should initially display a paragraph with the text "Welcome" and a button titled "Click". When the button is clicked, the message "Hello from JavaScript" in bold should replace the paragraph text.

### Sample 3: Form Validation with JavaScript
Develop an HTML form integrated with JavaScript for form validation. The form should include fields for the user's first name, last name, age, email address, and gender. Implement the following validation checks:

- Display a custom error message if any of the fields are left blank.
- If the 'age' field is not a number or exceeds 150, display a relevant error message.
- Display an appropriate error message if the 'email address' field does not match the standard email format.
